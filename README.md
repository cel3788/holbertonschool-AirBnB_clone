#  AirBnB clone - The console





## Description

The project aims to create a command-line interpreter for managing objects within an AirBnB clone application. This command interpreter serves as the foundation for subsequent stages of the project, including building a full web application.

Key features of the project include:

Object Management: Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete objects within the application using the command-line interface.

Serialization and Deserialization: Objects are serialized into JSON format for storage and deserialized for retrieval and manipulation.

Interactive and Non-Interactive Modes: The command interpreter supports both interactive mode, where users can enter commands directly, and non-interactive mode, where commands are passed as input.

Unit Testing: The project includes comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of all components, ensuring robustness and reliability.

Documentation: Extensive documentation is provided for modules, classes, functions, and command usage, facilitating understanding and usage of the command-line interface.

Overall, the project provides a solid foundation for building the AirBnB clone application, enabling efficient management of objects and seamless interaction with the application through the command-line interface.





## Learning objectives

Creating a Python package

Implementing a command interpreter using the cmd module

Writing and executing unit tests in a large project

Serializing and deserializing Python objects

Managing JSON files

Handling datetime and UUID objects

Using *args and **kwargs in functions







## Requirements
Python Scripts:

Files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.

Scripts should use the pycodestyle tool for style checking.

All files must be executable.

Documentation should be provided for modules, classes, and functions.

Python Unit Tests:

Tests should use the unittest module.

All test files should be inside a tests folder and start with test_.

Documentation should be provided for modules, classes, and functions.



## Usage/Examples

Starting the interpreter: To start the command interpreter, run the console.py script

    $ ./console.py

Interactive mode:

    (hbnb) [command]

Non interactive mode:

    $ echo "[command]" | ./console.py
